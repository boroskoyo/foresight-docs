  <div>
    One of our customers, Craftgate - a fintech company, has been using Foresight with a custom GitHub app, 
    which is fully PCI-DSS compliant. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs3PyNMeqXc&t=27s" target="_blank">You can watch his words from here.</a>

  <summary>Is there any way, where I don't install your GitHub app, but still use Foresight?</summary>
  <div>
    Yes, with our custom GitHub app solution, you can manage your own permissions. In this way
    you will be in charge of which permission you give access for Foresight. However, by limiting some of the 
    permissions, you may lose access some of the features.
