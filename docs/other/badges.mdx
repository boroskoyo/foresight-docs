# Dynamically generated test stats badges on your Readme's

Since badges provide users with a fast way to capture repository metrics, they increase the readability of the
repositories. You can effectively use Foresight's test badges on your repository to attract and keep
contributors.

the more trust you earn from your community. You can easily create badges after integrating your repository

Foresight calculates how your test code is performing. Foresight gathers the pure test execution duration, by removing the total beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, and afterAll duration from the total test run duration. With the Test Utilization Score badge, you can show how you wrote tests performing efficiently.

3) Successful Tests Badge
