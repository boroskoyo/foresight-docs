Foresight can monitor all GitHub Actions workflows and test frameworks such as JUnit, Jest, Python, TestNG, Trx and xUnit 2. 
All you need to do is installing Foresight's GitHub app and updating your YAML file so that Foresight can analyze your test report.  

It's fast, secure, and reliable â€” with zero-overhead.
