# Configuration

Start online debug sessions while the AWS Lambda functions run on AWS Cloud. 
Thundra sets up an easy and secure connection between your AWS Lambda functions and 
your favorite [IDE](#getting-started). Debug your serverless applications natively with their own permissions. 
Stop mocking resources and simulating the environments! Put breakpoints and pause
the execution of the [NodeJS](/configuration/nodejs), [Python](/configuration/python)  and [Java](/configuration/java) functions to see the error, variables, stack trace and more!
