:::info

This feature is currently under private beta.

:::

Foresight correlates the changes to the codebase with the test coverage reports to determine 
how much of the changes are covered by the tests, empowering teams with clear quality risk metrics 
to facilitate the right change management process. Pull requests can be automatically approved or 
passed through reviews depending on the quality risk to ensure only high-quality builds are moved
to production. 

## Prerequisites
- You need to add Foresight's Test Kit into your CI pipeline
- Supported coverage frameworks:
  - JaCoCo
  - Cobertura 
  - Golang

:::note
