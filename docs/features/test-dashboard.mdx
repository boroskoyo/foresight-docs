<br />
Foresight's test dashboard feature gives you a test-first perspective on the state of your CI. 
It can assist you in looking into performance issues and test failures over time and branch. 
<br />
<br />

:::info Setup
To start using test suite dashboard, you need to configure [Test kit](/advanced-configuration/test-kit) into your YAML. You can use: Cypress, Playwright, Selenium and many more
frameworks with JUnit, JSON and TXT report formats.

## Problems that Test Dashboard solves
- Which are the test suites / tests cause the most failure?
- What is the median, p90, p95 and the average duration of my test suites / tests?
- When is the most erroneous day?
- How is the performance of the test in my feature branches?
